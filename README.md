# EnigmaProject
This is a project for CIS4362 that focuses on recreating the famed "Enigma" cipher in C++, then updating the cipher using modern techniques. The group consists of Ginger Yu, Peter Sun, and Peter Theryo.

WW2EnigmaCode.cpp is the recreation of the 3-rotor + Plugboard model of the Enigma Cipher as it would have been used in World War 2. It encrypts messages of Uppercase Alphabetic characters. Rotors 2-5, Reflector C, and The Plugboard are examples of the respective parts for this device. 

BaseCipherProgram.cpp is our attemp to update the program using various modifications, the foremost being the inclusion of all 127 ASCII characters. Rotor 1, and Reflector B are examples of acceptable files for this version of the program.
